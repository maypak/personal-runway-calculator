## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Signups

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify channels (not just PH)
- A/B test messaging
- Improve landing page conversion
- Ask users: "Why didn't you sign up?"

---

### Risk 2: High Churn

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Improve onboarding (reduce time-to-value)
- Email engagement (weekly tips)
- Feature improvements (listen to feedback)
- Offboarding survey (learn why they left)

---

### Risk 3: No PMF

**Likelihood:** Low (beta signals are good)  
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Pivot early (if NPS <40)
- Talk to users (constant feedback)
- Iterate fast (weekly releases)
- Be willing to kill features

---

### Risk 4: Competition

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (first-mover advantage)
- Build community (moat)
- Focus on niche (runway, not general budgeting)
- Open source (differentiation)

---

## Decision Points

### End of Feb:
**Question:** Did PH launch go well?
- If YES (Top 5): Double down on content marketing
- If NO (didn't launch): Focus on other channels (Reddit, Twitter)

### End of Mar:
**Question:** Do we have PMF?
- If YES (NPS >50, retention >50%): Focus on growth
- If NO: Pivot or iterate (talk to users)

### End of Apr:
**Question:** Is monetization working?
- If YES ($500+ MRR): Scale paid acquisition
- If NO (<$100 MRR): Revisit pricing/features

---
