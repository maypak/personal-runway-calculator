- Trade-off: Can't plan retirement with us
- Future: Maybe simple projections

## Our Positioning Statement

```
For people planning to quit their job, go freelance, or take a career break,
Personal Runway Calculator is a free financial tool
that answers one question: "How long can I survive without income?"

Unlike general budgeting apps (YNAB, Mint, PocketSmith),
we focus exclusively on runway tracking — simple, fast, and privacy-first.
```

---

## Competitive Messaging

### When asked: "How is this different from YNAB?"

```
YNAB is awesome for budgeting with ongoing income.

Personal Runway Calculator is for the gap phase:
- Quit your job
- Between gigs
- Sabbatical
- Startup runway

We answer one question: "How long do I have?"
YNAB answers: "Where should my money go?"

Different problems, different tools.
```

---

### When asked: "Why not just use a spreadsheet?"

```
You absolutely can!

We built this for people who:
1. Find Excel intimidating
2. Want to check on their phone in 5 seconds
3. Need daily tracking without formulas

If you're comfortable with spreadsheets, stick with that.
This is for the rest of us 🙂
```

---

### When asked: "Is this worth paying for?"

```
Free tier is free forever (core runway calculator).

Pro ($20/mo) adds:
- Unlimited expense tracking
- Export to CSV/PDF
- Advanced analytics
- Priority support

Most people will be fine with free.
Pro is for power users who want extra features.
```
