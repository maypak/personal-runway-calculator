### First Comment Template

**Post this immediately after launch (12:01am PST):**

```
👋 Hi Product Hunt!

I'm May, and I quit my software engineering job after 10 years. Before taking the leap, I had one terrifying question:

**"How long can I survive without income?"**

I calculated my runway: **31 months**.

Not 31 months of *money*—31 months of *TIME*.

That shift changed everything. So I built this tool to help you do the same.

---

## What Personal Runway Calculator does:

✅ **Calculate your runway in 30 seconds**  
   Enter savings + monthly expenses → See how many months you have

✅ **Track daily expenses**  
   Log expenses, watch your runway update in real-time

✅ **Run "what-if" scenarios**  
   "What if I cut expenses 30%?"  
   "What if I earn $2K freelancing?"

✅ **Cloud sync across devices**  
   Check on phone, tablet, desktop - data syncs automatically

---

## Who it's for:

🧑‍💼 Planning to quit your 9-5  
🎨 Freelancers tracking runway  
🚀 Side project builders  
🌍 Digital nomads  
💸 Anyone pursuing financial freedom

---

## Why I built this:

Most finance apps focus on budgets, net worth, or retirement. But when you're in the "gap year" phase—between jobs, building a startup, or taking a sabbatical—you need to know ONE number:

**How much TIME do I have?**

This tool answers that question. No spreadsheet intimidation, no complex features. Just clarity.

---

## Tech stack:

- Next.js 16 (Turbopack)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (auth + database)
- Vercel (hosting)
- **Open source!** → github.com/maypak/personal-runway-calculator

---

## Privacy & Security:

- ✅ Your financial data is encrypted (Supabase RLS)
- ✅ No ads, no tracking, no selling data
- ✅ Open source—audit the code yourself
- ✅ Self-host if you want full control

---

## What's next:

This is v1 (MVP). Based on your feedback, I'm planning:

- Multi-currency support
- Recurring expenses automation
- Export to CSV/PDF
- Goal setting ("I need 18 months to build my startup")
- Mobile app (React Native)

**Vote on features:** Drop a comment with what you'd want most!

**Drop a comment!** I love talking about this stuff.

## Hunter vs Maker

**Option A: Self-Hunt** (No hunter)
- Pros: Keep control, authentic story
- Cons: Less initial boost

**Option B: Get a Hunter**
- Pros: Hunter's audience upvotes early (momentum)
- Cons: Sharing spotlight, need to find someone

**Recommendation for this project:** Self-hunt
- Personal story is the main hook
- Authentic solo founder narrative
- No need for external validation

If getting a hunter:
- Target: Someone in FIRE/personal finance space
- Reach out 1 week before launch
- Offer: Early access, thank them publicly

**Template DM:**
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Launching without preparing supporters (need 20-30 people ready to upvote in first hour)  
❌ Ignoring comments (reply to EVERY comment within 1 hour)  
❌ Not being online all day (launch day = 12+ hours active)  
❌ Generic first comment (tell a personal story, not a sales pitch)  
❌ Bad screenshots (blurry, cluttered, or too much text)  
❌ Launching on Monday (weekends have better engagement)  
❌ No social proof (get beta testers BEFORE launch)

---

## Backup Plan

**If launch flops (<100 upvotes):**
1. Don't panic—some great products had slow launches
2. Collect feedback from comments
3. Fix critical issues
4. Relaunch in 6 months (PH allows this)
5. Focus on other channels (Reddit, HN, Twitter)

**Remember:** PH is ONE channel. It's not make-or-break.
