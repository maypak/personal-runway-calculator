## Thread #1: Origin Story (10 tweets)

**Hook tweet:**
```
6 months ago I quit my engineering job after 10 years

The scariest part wasn't leaving—it was not knowing:

"How long can I actually survive without income?"

So I built a calculator. Here's what happened 🧵
```

---

**Tweet 2: The fear**
```
I had $80K saved

But no idea if that meant:
• 6 months?
• 12 months?
• 24 months?

Spreadsheets felt intimidating
So I just... didn't calculate

And stressed about money every single day
```

---

**Tweet 3: The breaking point**
```
One night at 2am, anxiety spiral:

"What if I run out of money in 3 months?"
"What if I can't find work again?"
"What if this is a huge mistake?"

I opened Excel
Did the math
Finally
```

---

**Tweet 4: The number**
```
Result: 31 months

2 years and 7 months

That number changed EVERYTHING

Suddenly:
❌ "Can I afford to quit?"
✅ "I have 2.5 years to figure this out"

Anxiety → Clarity
Fear → Confidence
```

---

**Tweet 5: The realization**
```
I checked that number every morning

Some days it went up (spent less)
Some days it went down (had fun)

But I KNEW where I stood

The number became my North Star

Not my bank balance—my RUNWAY
```

---

**Tweet 6: The idea**
```
Thought: "Why don't more people do this?"

Then realized:
• Excel is intimidating
• Mental math is fuzzy
• Banking apps don't show runway
• Budgeting apps are overkill

What if it was just... one number?
```

---

**Tweet 7: The build**
```
Spent 4 weeks building:

Personal Runway Calculator

```

"Holy shit, I have 18 months"
"Wait, only 9 months? I need to cut expenses"
"This makes it REAL"

Average rating: 9/10

```

## Thread #2: Feature Deep-Dive (8 tweets)

**Hook tweet:**
```
Your bank app shows you:
→ How much money you have

But NOT:
→ How long it will last

That's the difference between anxiety and clarity

Here's why runway > balance 🧵
```

---

**Tweet 2:**
```
Scenario:

Person A: $50K in savings
Person B: $50K in savings

Who's in better shape?

Impossible to say without knowing:
• Monthly expenses
• Income
• Burn rate

Same balance ≠ Same security
```

---

**Tweet 3:**
```
Add context:

Person A:
• $50K saved
• $5K/mo expenses
• Runway: 10 months

Person B:
• $50K saved
• $2K/mo expenses
• Runway: 25 months

NOW you know who's in better shape
```

---

**Tweet 4:**
```
This is why I built Personal Runway Calculator

Features:

1️⃣ Instant runway calculation
Input savings + expenses
See months/years remaining

Takes 30 seconds
No spreadsheet needed
```

---

**Tweet 5:**
```
2️⃣ Daily tracking

Add expenses as you go:
"$45 - groceries"
"$80 - dinner"

Runway updates automatically

You see impact immediately:
• Splurge today → runway -3 days
• Save today → runway +2 days
```

---

**Tweet 6:**
```
3️⃣ "What-if" scenarios

Before deciding:
"What if I cut rent by $500?"
→ Runway: 16mo → 21mo (+5 months!)

"What if I freelance $2K/mo?"
→ Runway: 12mo → Infinite ♾️

Test decisions BEFORE committing
```

---

**Tweet 7:**
```
4️⃣ Visual progress

Color-coded status:
🟢 Green: 24+ months (safe)
🟡 Yellow: 12-24 months (monitor)
🔴 Red: <12 months (take action)

Progress bar shows:
Where you are vs where you want to be
```

---

**Tweet 8:**
```
It's not rocket science

It's just:
Savings ÷ Monthly Expenses = Runway

But checking it daily?
Seeing it on your phone?
Watching it change in real-time?

That's what creates BEHAVIOR CHANGE

## Thread #3: User Stories (7 tweets)

**Hook tweet:**
```
3 people used Personal Runway Calculator

All had different results
All made different decisions

Here's what happened 🧵
```

---

**Tweet 2: Story A**
```
Sarah, 28, Designer

Before:
"I have $40K saved... is that enough to freelance?"

After using calculator:
→ Runway: 18 months

Decision:
"18 months is enough to try. If it fails, I find a job in month 15"

Quit 3 months ago. Now earning $6K/mo freelance.
```

---

**Tweet 3: Story B**
```
Mike, 35, Developer

Before:
"I'll quit when I have $100K saved"

After using calculator:
→ Runway: 36 months (with current $60K)

Realization:
"I already have 3 years! Why am I waiting?"

Quit last month. Building his own SaaS.
```

---

**Tweet 4: Story C**
```
Jenny, 31, Marketer

Before:
"I have $25K... probably not enough"

After using calculator:
→ Runway: 8 months

Decision:
"Too short. Need 18 months minimum"

Action:
Cut expenses (moved to cheaper city)
Picked up side gigs
Now at 15 months. Quitting next quarter.
```

---

**Tweet 5: Pattern**
```
Notice the pattern:

All 3 had savings
None knew their runway
Calculator gave clarity
Clarity enabled action

Sarah: Had enough, didn't know → quit
Mike: Had MORE than enough → quit
Jenny: Didn't have enough YET → plan

Same tool, 3 outcomes, all better off
```

---

**Tweet 6: The shift**
```
Before calculator:
"Can I afford this?" (vague anxiety)

After calculator:
"This costs 2 months of runway" (concrete trade-off)

The number makes decisions easier:
• Take that trip? -3 months
• Freelance gig? +4 months
• Cheaper apartment? +6 months

Math > Guessing
```

---

**Tweet 7: Your turn**
```
Calculate your runway today:
👉 [link]

Then make YOUR decision:
• Quit
• Wait
• Adjust expenses
• Build side income

Whatever you choose, at least you'll KNOW

Knowledge > Fear
```

## Thread #4: Common Objections (6 tweets)

**Hook tweet:**
```
"Just use a spreadsheet"
"Just do mental math"
"Just budget better"

I get these comments a lot

Here's why I built this anyway 🧵
```

---

**Tweet 2:**
```
Objection: "This is just savings ÷ expenses"

Response: Yep!

But:
• 80% of people don't calculate it
• Of those who do, 90% don't update it
• Friction kills habits

Making it EASY = people actually DO IT

Simple > Complex (unused)
```

---

**Tweet 3:**
```
Objection: "A spreadsheet can do this"

Response: Absolutely!

But:
• Can you check it on your phone in 5 seconds?
• Does it update automatically when you log spending?
• Can you share it across devices seamlessly?

Spreadsheets are powerful
They're also WORK
```

---

**Tweet 4:**
```
Objection: "What about the 4% rule?"

Response: Different use cases

4% rule = retirement planning (40 years)
Runway = gap phase (1-3 years)

Examples:
• Career break
• Startup attempt
• Freelance transition
• Sabbatical

Not everyone is pursuing full FIRE
```

---

**Tweet 5:**
```
Objection: "Privacy concerns with cloud app"

Response: Valid!

Options:
1. Use free tier (no signup, local only)
2. Self-host (it's open source)
3. Trust the encryption (Supabase, same as Notion)

You choose your comfort level

I built flexibility IN
```

---

**Tweet 6:**
```
Final thought:

You don't NEED this tool
(just like you don't NEED a gym)

But:
• Gyms make working out easier
• This makes runway tracking easier

If it helps 1 person quit their soul-crushing job with confidence...

Worth it 🙂

Never done this before
Slightly terrified
Very excited

```
My PH strategy:

Day -7 to -1:
• Post daily updates here

Day 0:
• Launch at 00:01 PST
• Reply to EVERY comment
• Monitor ranking
• Panic (probably)
```

---

**Tweet 3:**
```
What I'm worried about:

1. Ghost town (0 upvotes)
2. Brutal criticism ("this already exists")
3. Launching same day as GPT-6 (lol)

What I'm excited about:

1. Feedback from makers
2. Finding my first 100 users
3. Learning in public

Realistic goal: Top 10 of the day
```

## Thread #7: Educational (7 tweets)

**Hook tweet:**
```
Most people track their:
• Net worth
• Bank balance
• Monthly spending

But NOT their runway

Here's why runway is the MOST important number 🧵
```

---

**Tweet 2:**
```
What is runway?

How long you can survive without income

Formula:
Savings ÷ Monthly Expenses = Runway (months)

Example:
$60,000 ÷ $3,000/mo = 20 months

That's it. Dead simple.
```

---

**Tweet 3:**
```
Why it matters:

Scenario: You want to quit your job

Bank balance: $60,000
→ Feels scary (finite number going down)

Runway: 20 months
→ Feels manageable (concrete timeline)

Same money, different psychology
```

---

**Tweet 4:**
```
Runway changes behavior:

Before:
"Can I afford this $100 dinner?"
→ Vague guilt

After:
"This dinner costs 1 day of runway"
→ Concrete trade-off

Not about deprivation
About AWARENESS
```

---

**Tweet 5:**
```
Runway enables planning:

18-month runway:
→ Try 3 startups (6 mo each)
→ Or 1 startup (12 mo) + buffer (6 mo)
→ Or freelance part-time, extend to 30 mo

You can strategize when you know the constraints
```

---

**Tweet 6:**
```
How to extend runway:

Math: Runway = Savings ÷ Expenses

Two levers:
1. Increase savings (slower)
2. Decrease expenses (faster)

Example:
Cut expenses 30%: 12mo → 17mo (+5 months!)
Save $10K more: 12mo → 14mo (+2 months)

Expenses are the high-leverage move
```
