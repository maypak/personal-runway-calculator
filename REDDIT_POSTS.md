## Post #1: r/financialindependence

### Title (300 chars max)
```
[Tool] Built a personal runway calculator after quitting my job - calculate exactly how long your savings will last
```

### Body

```
Hey r/financialindependence 👋

I quit my engineering job last year after 10 years. Before taking the leap, the #1 question was:

**"How long can my savings actually last?"**

I know the 4% rule, I know spreadsheets exist, but I wanted something dead simple that I could check every day without friction.

So I built it: [Personal Runway Calculator](https://personal-runway-calculator.vercel.app)

---

## What it does:

✓ Calculate your runway in 30 seconds (savings ÷ monthly expenses)  
✓ Track daily expenses, see runway update in real-time  
✓ "What-if" scenarios: "What if I cut expenses 30%? What if I earn $2K freelancing?"  
✓ Cloud sync, mobile-friendly, completely free  

---

## Why I'm sharing this here:

This community helped me realize FIRE was possible. Seeing posts about "FI number" and "one more year syndrome" gave me the confidence to calculate my own runway (31 months) and quit.

The calculator isn't revolutionary - it's just **friction-free**. No spreadsheet intimidation, no mental math, just one number you can check anytime.

---

## Screenshots:

## It's free and open source:

- Free tier: Basic runway calculator + 50 expenses/month
- No ads, no tracking, no selling data
- Source code: [GitHub link]

---

## Early access (50 spots):

I'm looking for 50 beta users to test and give feedback before the public launch. If you're interested:

- Lifetime Pro features (unlimited tracking, exports)
- Vote on next features
- Priority support

## FAQ I'm expecting:

**Q: Is this just a glorified calculator?**  
A: Kind of, yes. But the power is in daily tracking + seeing your runway change. It makes the abstract (savings) concrete (months left).

**Q: Why not just use a spreadsheet?**  
A: You absolutely can! This is for people like me who wanted something they could check on their phone in 5 seconds without opening Excel.

**Q: What about the 4% rule?**  
A: This is more for people in the "gap year" / "career break" / "runway to next thing" phase, not full FIRE retirement. Different use case.

**Q: Privacy concerns?**  
A: End-to-end encrypted, stored with Supabase (used by thousands of companies). Or self-host the open-source version if you prefer.

---

## What I learned building this:

The number itself (31 months) gave me so much clarity. It turned:

- "Can I afford to quit?" → "Yes, I have 2.5 years"
- "What if I fail?" → "I have time to try 3 different things"
- Anxiety → Confidence

Hope this helps someone else in the same boat!

Happy to answer any questions below 🙏

## Post #2: r/Fire (Shorter, More Personal)

### Title
```
[32M] Used this calculator to quit my job with 31-month runway - sharing the tool
```

### Body

```
Quick backstory:

- 32M, software engineer, 10 years at same company
- Wanted to quit for 2 years but too scared
- Biggest fear: "Will my savings run out?"

I built a simple runway calculator to answer that question.

Result: **31 months** (2yr 7mo)

That number changed everything. Suddenly "can I quit?" became "I have 2.5 years to figure this out."

---

## The Tool:

👉 [Personal Runway Calculator](https://personal-runway-calculator.vercel.app)

**What it does:**
- Enter savings + monthly expenses
- Get your runway (months/years)
- Track daily spending, watch runway update
- Test "what-if" scenarios

**What it doesn't do:**
- Replace your FI calculator (this is for pre-FIRE runway tracking)
- Account for taxes, healthcare, etc. (you input net expenses)

---

## My Runway Journey:

**Month 0 (quit day):** 31 months  
**Month 3 (now):** 28 months (spending faster than expected)  
**Lesson:** Daily tracking keeps me accountable

The tool isn't magic - it's just **constant awareness**. Checking it every morning reminds me to be mindful.

---

## For this community:

I know most of you have sophisticated FI spreadsheets. This is more for:

- Coast FIRE folks tracking the gap
- People in "one more year" limbo
- Anyone planning a career break

It's free, open source, no BS.

## Post #3: r/SideProject (Show & Tell)

### Title
```
Built a personal runway calculator in 4 weeks - helping people quit their jobs with confidence
```

### Body

```
## Project: Personal Runway Calculator

**What:** Calculate how long you can survive without a job  
**Why:** I quit my job and needed this clarity  
**Link:** https://personal-runway-calculator.vercel.app

---

## The Problem:

50% of people thinking about quitting their jobs don't know their financial runway. They have savings, but no idea if it's 6 months or 2 years worth.

Spreadsheets exist, but friction is high. Most people just... don't calculate it. Then stress about money.

---

## The Solution:

30-second calculator:
1. Enter savings
2. Enter monthly expenses
3. See runway

Then track daily expenses to keep it accurate.

---

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind
- **Backend:** Supabase (auth + database)
- **Deploy:** Vercel
- **Time:** 4 weeks (nights & weekends)

**Why this stack:**
- Wanted to learn Supabase (been meaning to)
- Vercel makes deployment trivial
- Tailwind = fast UI iteration

---

## Traction so far:

- 7 alpha testers (friends)
- Avg rating: 9/10
- Main feedback: "Way simpler than my spreadsheet"
- Now recruiting 50 beta testers

---

## What I'd do differently:

✓ **Right:** Started with MVP (just the calculator)  
✗ **Wrong:** Spent too long on "what-if" feature (nobody asked for it)  
✓ **Right:** Supabase RLS policies (learned a ton)  
✗ **Wrong:** Didn't set up analytics early (missed early user behavior)

---

## Next steps:

1. Beta testing (2 weeks)
2. Product Hunt launch
3. Add requested features (multi-currency, PDF export)

---

## Looking for:

- **Beta testers:** [form link] (50 spots)
- **Feedback:** What would make you actually use this?
- **Ideas:** What features am I missing?

---

## Open Questions:

1. **Pricing:** Free vs $5/mo vs $20/mo for Pro features?
2. **Marketing:** Where do I find my users? (besides Reddit)
3. **Differentiation:** How to stand out vs existing budgeting apps?

Would love your thoughts!

## Post #4: r/Entrepreneur (Problem-Solution Focus)

### Title
```
Quit my job with 31-month runway - built a free tool to help others do the same
```

### Body

```
Entrepreneurs: Do you know your personal runway?

Not your startup's runway. **Your personal runway.**

How long can YOU survive without income?

---

## Why This Matters:

Before I quit my job to build products, I needed to answer:

- "Can I afford 6 months of no income?"
- "What if my first idea fails?"
- "How long until I HAVE to get a job again?"

I had $80K saved. But no clue if that was 12 months or 24 months.

---

## The Calculator:

Built this: [Personal Runway Calculator](https://personal-runway-calculator.vercel.app)

**My result:** 31 months (2yr 7mo)

That number = confidence to quit.

---

## How Entrepreneurs Use It:

**Solo founder A:**
- Runway: 18 months
- Strategy: Try 3 ideas (6 months each)
- Peace of mind: Knows the deadline

**Freelancer B:**
- Runway: 12 months
- Strategy: Client work while building SaaS
- Daily tracking: Sees if freelancing extends runway

**Career switcher C:**
- Runway: 24 months
- Strategy: Learn to code, build portfolio
- What-if: "If I get freelance gigs, runway → 36 months"

---

Track your nomad runway - free tool I built after going remote full-time

Digital nomads: How long can you travel before you need income?

I went full nomad 6 months ago. Biggest question wasn't "where to go" - it was **"how long can I afford this?"**

---

## The Problem:

Living costs vary wildly:
- Bangkok: $1,200/mo
- Lisbon: $2,800/mo
- Bali: $1,500/mo

Your runway changes with each destination.

---

## The Tool:

Built this: [Personal Runway Calculator](https://personal-runway-calculator.vercel.app)

**How nomads use it:**

**Before trip:**
- Enter savings: $40K
- Monthly burn: $2,500
- Runway: 16 months ✅

**Month 3 (Bali):**
- Actual spending: $1,800/mo
- New runway: 22 months! 🎉
- Insight: Can travel longer than expected

**Month 6 (Europe):**
- Spending: $3,200/mo 😅
- Runway: Back to 12 months
- Decision: Move to cheaper city

---

## Features for Nomads:

✓ **Quick check:** Open on phone, see runway instantly  
✓ **Track spending:** Log as you go, see impact  
✓ **What-if:** "Can I afford 3 months in Japan?"  
✓ **Multi-device sync:** Phone, laptop, tablet  

---

## My Stats (6 months):

| Location | Monthly Burn | Runway |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Bangkok | $1,350 | 29 mo |
| Chiang Mai | $1,100 | 36 mo |
| Bali | $1,750 | 22 mo |
| Lisbon | $3,100 | 12 mo |

**Lesson:** Cheap SE Asia extended my runway by 12 months.

---

## Why I Built This:

Nomading without knowing your runway = constant anxiety.

"Can I book this Airbnb?"  
"Should I skip this activity?"  
"Do I need to start freelancing NOW?"

One number answers all these questions.

---

## It's Free:

- Basic features: Free forever
- Pro ($20/mo): Unlimited tracking, multi-currency (coming soon)
- Beta testers: Pro free for life

---

## Discussion:

1. What's your current runway?
2. How do you track spending while traveling?
3. What features would make this more useful for nomads?
