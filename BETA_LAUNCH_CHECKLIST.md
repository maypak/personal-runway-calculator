## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: P0 Features Delay

**Risk:** Can't ship all 4 features in 4 weeks

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize: Scenario > i18n > FIRE > Phase
- Soft launch: Launch with 2 features, add others weekly
- Communication: Be transparent with beta users

**Fallback Plan:**
- Launch with Scenario + i18n only
- Add FIRE + Phase in Week 2-3 of public beta

---

### Risk 2: Low Signup Numbers

**Risk:** <100 signups in Week 1

**Mitigation:**
- Paid ads (Product Hunt, Reddit)
- Influencer outreach (FIRE bloggers, career coaches)
- Community engagement (Reddit AMAs)

**Fallback Plan:**
- Extend private beta (recruit more testers)
- Delay public launch 1-2 weeks

---

### Risk 3: Critical Bugs

**Risk:** Major bugs discovered in public beta

**Mitigation:**
- Thorough private beta testing
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Hotfix process (deploy within 4 hours)

**Fallback Plan:**
- Pause signups temporarily
- Fix critical bugs
- Resume launch

---

### Risk 4: Poor User Retention

**Risk:** Users sign up but don't return

**Mitigation:**
- Email drip campaign (Day 3, 7, 14)
- Discord community engagement
- Feature announcements (keep them excited)

**Fallback Plan:**
- User interviews (why did you leave?)
- Iterate on onboarding
- Improve feature discovery
