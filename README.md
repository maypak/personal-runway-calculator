# Personal Runway Calculator 🚀

**Financial Freedom Tracker for Freelancers, Digital Nomads & Indie Hackers**

---

## 🎯 What is this?

A Notion template (and Next.js web app) that helps you calculate your **personal runway** — how long you can survive without a job.

Built by a software engineer who quit after 10 years. I calculated my runway (31 months) and it gave me the confidence to take the leap.

Now I'm sharing this tool with you.

## 💡 Why I built this

I worked as a software engineer for 10+ years. When I decided to quit, my biggest fear was:

> "How long can I survive without income?"

I built this calculator to answer that question. My result: **31 months**.

That number gave me confidence. Now it's your turn.
