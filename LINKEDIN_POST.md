## Main Post (1,300 chars - LinkedIn max)

```
6 months ago, I quit my engineering job after 10 years.

Before I quit, I had one terrifying question:

"How long can I actually survive without income?"

I had $80,000 saved. But I didn't know if that was 6 months or 2 years.

So at 2am, anxiety spiraling, I finally opened Excel and did the math.

Result: 31 months (2 years, 7 months)

That number changed everything.

❌ "Can I afford to quit?" → ✅ "I have 2.5 years to figure this out"

Anxiety → Clarity
Fear → Confidence

---

That one number gave me the courage to take the leap.

So I built a free tool to help others do the same:

👉 Personal Runway Calculator
https://personal-runway-calculator.vercel.app

Calculate your runway in 30 seconds:
• Enter savings
• Enter monthly expenses
• See how many months/years you have

Track daily. Test "what-if" scenarios. Make confident decisions.

---

I know many of you are thinking about:
• Leaving your 9-5
• Going freelance
• Starting a company
• Taking a sabbatical

Before you do, calculate your runway.

That one number will give you more confidence than any LinkedIn motivational post.

Try it (it's free, no signup required):

Would love your feedback, especially from:
• People who recently quit their jobs
• Freelancers/founders tracking runway
• Anyone planning a career break

What would make this more useful for you?

Comment or DM me 🙏

```

That clarity gave me confidence.

### Version 3: Founder Angle (for startup network)

```
Before I quit my job to build a startup, I asked myself:

"How long can I survive without income?"

I had savings. But no idea if it was 6 months or 2 years.

Calculated my runway: 31 months.

That number = confidence to quit.

---

Now I help others calculate theirs:

Personal Runway Calculator (free tool)
https://personal-runway-calculator.vercel.app

30 seconds to answer:
"How long until I run out of money?"

---

For founders:
• Your startup runway matters
• But your PERSONAL runway matters more
• If you run out of cash before PMF, game over

Calculate both. Track both. Extend both.

## Follow-Up Posts (Engagement Series)

### Post 2: Lessons Learned (3 days later)

```
3 days since I shared Personal Runway Calculator.

Overwhelmed by the response 🙏

Key insights from 200+ conversations:

1️⃣ "I had no idea I had 18 months. I can actually quit!"
→ Most people underestimate their runway

2️⃣ "I thought I had 2 years, turns out it's 8 months."
→ Some people overestimate (equally dangerous)

3️⃣ "This made me realize I need to cut expenses first."
→ Clarity drives action

The pattern:
Before calculator = vague anxiety
After calculator = concrete plan

Knowledge > Fear

### Post 3: User Story (1 week later)

```
Just got this message from a user:

"I've been scared to quit my job for 2 years.

Your calculator showed me I have 22 months of runway.

I handed in my notice today.

Thank you."

---

This is why I built this.

Not for the revenue (it's free).
Not for the recognition.

For moments like this.

One person gaining clarity.
One person taking the leap.
One person choosing themselves.

---

If you're on the fence about:
• Quitting your job
• Going freelance
• Starting a company
• Taking time off

Calculate your runway first.

You might be surprised by how much time you actually have.

### Post 4: Behind the Scenes (2 weeks later)

```
Building in public: Week 2 update

Personal Runway Calculator:
• 500 users 🎉
• 15 countries
• 2,000 runway calculations
• 1,200 expenses tracked

What I learned:

1️⃣ People want simplicity
→ "30-sec setup" was the #1 praise

2️⃣ Privacy matters
→ "No ads, no data selling" = trust

3️⃣ Free tier is powerful
→ 95% of users don't need Pro (yet that's okay)

What's next:
• Recurring expenses (most requested)
• Export to CSV (data portability)
• Multi-currency (international users)

Building this in public.
Mistakes, lessons, wins — all shared.

Great idea! I've added this to the roadmap. Would this be a must-have or nice-to-have for you?

Totally valid! Excel is powerful. This is for people who find it intimidating (like my non-tech friends). Different tools for different folks 🙂

Happy to share my experience! The short answer: Calculate your runway, cut unnecessary expenses, and build a small safety net on top. DM me if you want to chat 1-on-1.
