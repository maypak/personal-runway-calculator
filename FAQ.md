## Using the Calculator

### 6. How accurate is the calculator?

**Short answer:** As accurate as your inputs.

**The math is precise:**
- Basic runway: `Savings / (Expenses - Income)`
- FIRE calculations: Industry-standard 4% rule
- Investment returns: Compound interest formula
- Phase planning: Month-by-month projection

**But accuracy depends on YOU:**

**✅ Accurate inputs = Accurate results:**
- Realistic expense estimates
- Conservative income projections
- Regular updates (monthly)

**❌ Garbage in = Garbage out:**
- Underestimating expenses (common!)
- Overestimating side income
- Forgetting irregular costs (car repair, medical)

**Pro tips for accuracy:**
1. **Overestimate expenses by 10-15%** (buffer for surprises)
2. **Underestimate income by 20-30%** (freelance is unpredictable)
3. **Review bank statements** (don't guess!)
4. **Update monthly** (life changes)

**Beta tester quote:**
> *"First calculation: 18 months. After reviewing bank statements: 14 months. Reality check saved me."*  
> — Thomas, Aspiring Founder

---

### 7. What counts as "savings"?

**✅ Include:**
- Checking account balance
- Savings account balance
- Money market accounts
- CDs (if accessible without penalty)
- Cash (yes, literal cash)
- Liquid brokerage accounts (non-retirement)

**❌ Don't include:**
- Retirement accounts (401k, IRA, Roth IRA)
  - Why: Early withdrawal = penalties + taxes
  - Exception: If you plan to use Rule 72(t), ask an advisor
- Home equity
  - Why: Not liquid
  - Exception: HELOC (home equity line of credit) - maybe, but risky
- Investment properties
- Anything you can't access in <30 days

**Gray area:**
- **Emergency fund:** Include it, but mentally note it's your safety net
- **Crypto:** Include if you'd sell it for living expenses (volatile!)
- **Stocks:** Include if you'd liquidate (but consider taxes)

**Example calculation:**
```
Checking: $15,000 ✅
Savings: $30,000 ✅
401k: $100,000 ❌ (don't include)
Brokerage: $10,000 ✅ (taxable account)
Crypto: $5,000 ✅ (if you'd sell)
Emergency fund: $15,000 ✅ (but keep as buffer)

Total to enter: $60,000
(Or $45,000 if excluding emergency fund)
```

**Conservative approach:** Exclude emergency fund. Better safe than sorry.

---

### 8. Should I include my emergency fund?

**Short answer:** Depends on your risk tolerance.

**Conservative approach (recommended):**
- ❌ Don't include emergency fund
- Keep it as separate safety net
- Use only "runway savings"

**Example:**
```
Total liquid savings: $60,000
Emergency fund: $15,000 (6 months expenses)
Runway savings: $45,000
Enter: $45,000
```

**Aggressive approach:**
- ✅ Include emergency fund
- Rationalize: "Quitting IS an emergency!"
- Longer runway, but riskier

**Example:**
```
Enter: $60,000 (all savings)
```

**Our recommendation:**
- Use conservative for planning
- Know aggressive exists as backup
- Create 2 scenarios:
  - Scenario A: Without emergency fund (safer)
  - Scenario B: With emergency fund (if desperate)

**Beta tester insight:**
> *"I included emergency fund at first (24mo runway). Then excluded it (18mo). Made me save 3 more months before quitting. Best decision."*  
> — 최소연, Career Transitioner

---

### 9. How do I estimate monthly expenses?

**Method 1: Review bank statements (most accurate)**

**Steps:**
1. Export last 3-6 months of transactions
2. Categorize expenses:
   - Rent/mortgage
   - Utilities (electric, water, internet)
   - Food (groceries + eating out)
   - Transportation (car, gas, insurance, Uber)
   - Insurance (health, car, home)
   - Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, gym)
   - Shopping (clothes, Amazon, etc.)
   - Entertainment (movies, bars, hobbies)
   - Miscellaneous (everything else)
3. Average monthly totals
4. Add 10-15% buffer

**Example:**
```
Rent: $1,500
Utilities: $200
Food: $600
Transport: $300
Insurance: $350
Subscriptions: $100
Shopping: $250
Entertainment: $200
Misc: $200
-----------
Total: $3,700
Buffer (10%): $370
-----------
Enter: $4,070/mo
```

---

**Method 2: Quick estimation (less accurate)**

Use this formula:
```
Monthly Expenses = 
  Fixed (rent, insurance) + 
  Variable (food, fun) + 
  Buffer (10%)
```

**Example:**
```
Fixed: $2,000 (rent $1,500 + insurance $500)
Variable: $1,000 (food, transport, fun)
Buffer: $300
Total: $3,300/mo
```

---

**Common mistakes:**

**❌ Forgetting irregular expenses:**
- Annual subscriptions (Amazon Prime)
- Car registration, maintenance
- Medical/dental (co-pays, meds)
- Gifts (birthdays, holidays)
- Travel

**✅ Fix:** Add them!
```
Annual irregular: $3,600
Monthly equivalent: $300/mo
Add to your total
```

**❌ Using "ideal" budget:**
- "I should spend $2K/mo" (but actually spend $3.5K)

**✅ Fix:** Use reality, not ideals.

---

**Pro tips:**

1. **Use budgeting app for 1 month:** Mint, YNAB, etc. → Get accurate data
2. **Separate "employed" vs "unemployed" budgets:**
   - Employed: $3,500/mo (eating out, commuting, work clothes)
   - Unemployed: $2,800/mo (cook at home, no commute, casual clothes)
3. **Create 2 scenarios:** Realistic vs Lean

---

### 10. What about taxes?

**Good question!** Taxes depend on your income sources.

**If you have NO income (living off savings):**
- ❌ No taxes on withdrawals from savings accounts
- You're just spending your own money

**If you have side income (freelance, consulting):**
- ✅ Taxes apply!
- Estimate: 25-30% (US federal + state + self-employment tax)
- **Important:** Enter AFTER-TAX income in calculator

**Example:**
```
Freelance income (gross): $2,000/mo
Taxes (30%): -$600
After-tax: $1,400/mo
Enter: $1,400
```

**If you sell investments (stocks, crypto):**
- Capital gains tax applies
- Short-term (<1 year): Ordinary income tax rate
- Long-term (>1 year): 0-20% (depending on income)

**Beta tester mistake:**
> *"I entered $3K/mo freelance income, forgot about taxes. Ran out of money 3 months early. Ouch."*  
> — Kevin, Freelance Designer

**Our recommendation:**
- ✅ Always enter after-tax numbers
- ✅ Overestimate taxes (better safe)
- ✅ Consult a tax professional (we're not tax advisors!)

## Features

### 11. What is Scenario Comparison?

**Scenario Comparison** lets you compare multiple "what-if" plans side-by-side.

**Example use cases:**

**1. Job search timeline:**
- Scenario A: 6-month runway (aggressive)
- Scenario B: 12-month runway (safe)
- **Compare:** Trade-off between saving longer vs starting sooner

**2. Geographic arbitrage:**
- Scenario A: Stay in SF ($8K/mo)
- Scenario B: Move to Bali ($2.5K/mo)
- **Compare:** Impact on runway (15mo → 48mo!)

**3. Bootstrap vs VC:**
- Scenario A: Bootstrap 12mo ($5K/mo burn)
- Scenario B: Raise $500K VC (24mo, $25K/mo burn)
- **Compare:** Equity dilution vs speed

**How to use:**
1. Create your baseline scenario
2. Click "Duplicate" → Modify
3. Repeat for 2-5 scenarios
4. Click "Compare" → See side-by-side table + charts

**Beta tester quote:**
> *"Scenario comparison = my co-founder. Showed me bootstrap 18mo vs VC 24mo. Chose bootstrap. Best decision."*  
> — Michael, Founder

---

### 12. What is Phase Planning?

**Phase Planning** lets you model journeys with different stages and budgets.

**Why it matters:**
Most life transitions aren't one flat budget.

**Example: Sabbatical**
```
Phase 1: Asia (3mo, $2.5K/mo) - cheap
Phase 2: Europe (3mo, $5K/mo) - expensive
Phase 3: Job search (6mo, $3.5K/mo) - moderate

Average: $3,667/mo (misleading!)
Reality: $42K over 12mo (phases show truth)
```

**Without phases:**
- You'd budget $3,667/mo × 12 = $44K
- But Phase 2 hits → overspend → panic

**With phases:**
- Know exactly when expenses spike
- Plan cash flow accurately
- Sleep better at night

**How to use:**
1. Go to "Phases" tab
2. Click "Add Phase"
3. Enter: Name, duration, budget, income
4. Repeat for each stage
5. See total runway + phase timeline

**Beta tester quote:**
> *"Phase planning saved my sabbatical. I knew Phase 2 (Europe) would drain $15K in 3 months. Prepared mentally + financially."*  
> — Emma, Sabbatical Planner

### 13. What is the FIRE Calculator?

**FIRE = Financial Independence, Retire Early**

Our FIRE Calculator has 4 tools:

**1. FI Number** (How much you need)
- Formula: Annual Expenses / 0.04 (4% rule)
- Example: $48K/year expenses → $1.2M FI Number

**2. FI Date** (When you'll reach FI)
- Factors: Current savings + monthly savings + investment returns
- Example: $400K now + $8K/mo + 7% return = Oct 2030

**3. Coast FIRE** (When you can stop saving)
- Amount that grows to FI Number by retirement age
- Example: Age 35, need $1.2M at 65 → Coast = $200K

**4. Progress Tracking** (Visual journey)
- See how far you've come
- Stay motivated

**Who it's for:**
- FIRE seekers (obviously!)
- Anyone curious about long-term financial freedom
- People who want to know "when can I relax?"

**Beta tester quote:**
> *"Discovered I already hit Coast FIRE. Switched to 3-day workweek immediately. Life-changing."*  
> — 박준영, Doctor

## Troubleshooting

### 26. The calculator shows negative months

**What it means:**
Your expenses exceed your savings immediately.

**Example:**
```
Savings: $5,000
Monthly expenses: $3,000
Monthly income: $0
Result: 1.67 months (almost negative)
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Increase savings:**
- Save more before quitting
- Target: 6-12 months runway minimum

**2. Reduce expenses:**
- Move to cheaper location
- Cut non-essentials
- Live with family/friends

**3. Add income:**
- Freelance / side hustle
- Part-time work
- Passive income

**4. Delay your plan:**
- Stay employed 3-6 more months
- Build bigger cushion
- Reduce stress

**Beta tester experience:**
> *"First calc: 4 months. Scary! Saved 6 more months, added freelance, got to 18mo. Much better."*  
> — Kevin, Aspiring Founder

---

### 27. My scenarios aren't saving

**Possible causes:**

**1. No account / not logged in**
- Scenarios save to browser only (temporary)
- Solution: Create account → Log in

**2. Browser data cleared**
- Cookies/cache deleted = data lost
- Solution: Use cloud sync (requires account)

**3. Incognito/Private mode**
- Data not saved in private browsing
- Solution: Use normal browser window

**4. Browser bug**
- Rare, but happens
- Solution: Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**How to prevent:**
1. Create an account
2. Log in before creating scenarios
3. Enable cloud sync (Settings → Data)

**Lost your data?**
- If you had cloud sync: Email support@personalrunway.app
- If local only: Unfortunately unrecoverable 😞

---

### 28. The app is slow or laggy

**Possible causes + solutions:**

**1. Too many scenarios/phases**
- Limit: 50+ scenarios can slow down
- Solution: Archive old scenarios

**2. Slow internet**
- Cloud sync requires internet
- Solution: Use local-only mode (Settings)

**3. Old browser**
- We support: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
