## 📊 Test Summary

**Result:** 9/10 Passed (90% pass rate)

- ✅ Passed: 9 tests
- ❌ Failed: 1 test
- ⏱️ Duration: 7.8 seconds

## ❌ Failed Tests

### 1. Authentication Flow › should show sign up form

**File:** `tests/auth.spec.ts:18:18`

**Error:**
```
Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed

Locator: getByText('At least 6 characters')
Expected: visible
Timeout: 5000ms
```

**Screenshot:** `test-results/auth-Authentication-Flow-should-show-sign-up-form-chromium/test-failed-1.png`

**What Happened:**
The test expected to find the text "At least 6 characters" as part of the password validation message, but this text was not present on the page.

**Actual State:**
According to the DOM snapshot, the current password validation message is:
> "12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character"

This indicates that the password requirements have been **strengthened** from the original 6-character minimum to a more secure 12-character minimum with complexity requirements.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Category:** Test Maintenance Issue (Not a Production Bug)

**Cause:**
The password validation requirements were updated in production to enforce stronger security (12+ characters with complexity), but the E2E test was not updated to reflect this change.

**Impact:**
- Production functionality is working correctly ✅
- The test is checking for outdated validation text ❌
- False negative: Test fails even though the feature works better than before

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Update Test Expectations (Recommended)

Update `tests/auth.spec.ts` around line 20-25 to check for the new password validation text:

```typescript
// OLD (failing):
await expect(page.getByText('At least 6 characters')).toBeVisible();

// NEW (correct):
await expect(page.getByText('12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character')).toBeVisible();
```

### Fix 2: Use More Flexible Assertion

Alternatively, check for the presence of password validation without hard-coding the exact text:

```typescript
// Check that password validation exists (flexible):
await expect(page.locator('[role="generic"]:has-text("character")')).toBeVisible();
```

## ✅ Passing Tests

1. ✅ Authentication Flow › should load auth page successfully
2. ✅ Authentication Flow › should attempt email signup
3. ✅ Authentication Flow › should show OAuth buttons
4. ✅ Authentication Flow › should validate email format
5. ✅ Authentication Flow › should validate password length
6. ✅ Authentication Flow › should toggle between sign in and sign up
7. ✅ Authentication Flow › should have no console errors on page load
8. ✅ Authentication Flow › should be mobile responsive
9. ✅ Authentication Flow › should load within 3 seconds

## 📌 Notes

- Production site is healthy and performing well
- All core functionality (auth, navigation, responsiveness, performance) passed
- The single failure is due to outdated test expectations, not a regression
- Consider updating test suite when password requirements change to avoid false negatives

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Update `tests/auth.spec.ts` to match current password validation text
2. **Short-term:** Consider documenting password requirements in `qa-scenarios.md`
3. **Long-term:** Add test coverage for password strength validation (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)

---

**Status:** Production is stable. Test suite needs sync with latest password requirements.
