## Content Strategy

### Pre-Launch (Feb 15-22)

**Goals:**
- Build anticipation
- Attract beta testers
- Share journey (build in public)
- Engage with FIRE/indie hacker community

**Tweet Types:**

#### 1. Origin Story
```
I worked 10 years as a software engineer.

When I decided to quit, my biggest fear was:
"How long can I survive without income?"

I built a calculator. My runway: 31 months.

That number gave me confidence to take the leap.

Now I'm sharing this tool with you. 🧵👇
```

#### 2. Problem-Focused
```
Most people think in dollars:
"I have $50,000 saved"

But what you really have is TIME:
"I have 12 months of freedom"

That's a runway.

And knowing your runway changes everything.
```

#### 3. Beta Invitation
```
🚀 Looking for 10 beta testers

If you're:
- Planning to quit your job
- Freelancing / side hustling
- Pursuing financial freedom

I need your feedback on my new tool.

Comment "runway" and I'll DM you ⬇️
```

#### 4. Feature Highlight
```
Personal Runway Calculator can tell you:

✅ How many months you can last
✅ When you'll run out of money
✅ If you can afford to quit

All in real-time. Free. No ads.

Beta link in bio 👆
```

#### 5. Behind-the-Scenes
```
Spent 2 hours today fixing a P0 bug.

Data wasn't persisting after refresh.

Root cause: Supabase RLS + UPSERT conflict.

Fix: Conditional INSERT/UPDATE.

Shipped to production in 9 minutes.

Building in public is intense. 🚀
