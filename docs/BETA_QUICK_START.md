## 🎯 Step 5: See Your Runway! (instant)

Your runway is automatically calculated:

**Formula:**
```
Net Monthly: Income - Expenses = $5,800 - $3,500 = $2,300 (surplus)
Runway: Savings / Monthly Burn = $45,000 / $3,500 = 12.9 months

If you have surplus: Runway = ∞ (you're gaining money!)
```

### What Your Runway Means:

- **Green (12+ months):** You're good! Comfortable runway for career moves
- **Yellow (6-12 months):** Moderate risk. Plan carefully.
- **Red (<6 months):** Tight! Consider increasing savings or income first

## 🔥 What To Do Next

### Scenario 1: Planning a Sabbatical
**Question:** "Can I afford a 6-month career break?"

1. Current runway: 12.9 months
2. During sabbatical: Income = $0
3. New runway: $45,000 / $3,500 = **12.9 months**
4. **Answer:** Yes! You can take a 6-month break and still have 6+ months runway left

### Scenario 2: Considering a Startup
**Question:** "How long can I work on my startup full-time?"

1. Quit job → Income drops to $0 (assuming no startup revenue yet)
2. Expenses stay: $3,500/month
3. Runway: $45,000 / $3,500 = **12.9 months**
4. **Answer:** You have ~1 year to get your startup profitable

### Scenario 3: FIRE Planning
**Question:** "When can I retire early?"

**Coming in Week 3!** We're building a FIRE calculator that will:
- Calculate your FI Number (4% rule)
- Estimate your FI Date (with investment growth)
- Track progress toward FIRE

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Be Realistic with Expenses
Don't underestimate! Include:
- Yearly expenses (divide by 12): insurance, car registration, gifts, travel
- "Surprise" expenses: medical, home repairs, etc.
- Buffer: Add 10-20% for unexpected costs

### Tip 2: Track Variable Income
If your income fluctuates (freelancer, contractor):
- Use **average monthly income** (last 3-6 months)
- OR use **minimum monthly income** (conservative estimate)

### Tip 3: Update Monthly
Your runway changes as you:
- Spend money (savings decrease)
- Earn money (savings increase)
- Change jobs (income changes)

Set a reminder to update your numbers monthly!
