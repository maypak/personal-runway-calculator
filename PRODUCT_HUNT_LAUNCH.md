Hey [Name],

I'm launching Personal Runway Calculator on Product Hunt this month - a free tool that helps people calculate how long they can survive without a job.

I've seen you hunt products in the [finance/productivity] space and thought this might align with your interests.

Would you be open to hunting it?

If not, no worries! Just thought I'd ask.

Here's a preview: [staging link]

Cheers,
[Your name]
```

**If self-hunting:**

---

### Hours 6-12 (06:00 - 12:00 PST)

**Momentum maintenance:**

- [ ] Continue replying to comments
- [ ] Engage with makers commenting on other launches (build relationships)
- [ ] Share milestones:
  - "100 upvotes! 🎉"
  - "Top 3! Thank you!"
  - User testimonial screenshots
- [ ] Drive external traffic:
  - Twitter threads
  - Reddit engagement
  - Email blast

**Common questions to expect:**

**Q: "How is this different from [competitor]?"**
```
Great question! [Competitor] is awesome for [use case].

Personal Runway Calculator is focused specifically on [your differentiator]:
- Simpler (30-sec setup vs their 10-min onboarding)
- Free (vs their $X/month)
- Runway-first (vs general budgeting)

Different tools for different needs!
```

**Q: "What's your business model?"**
```
Freemium:
- Free: Core runway calculator + basic tracking
- Pro ($20/mo): Unlimited expenses, exports, analytics

Goal: Make it sustainable so I can keep building features users want 🙂
```

**Q: "Privacy/security concerns?"**
```
Totally fair concern!

- End-to-end encrypted
- Stored with Supabase (GDPR compliant)
- No selling data, ever
- Open source available if you want to self-host

Your data = yours.
```

**Q: "Why did you build this?"**
```
Personal story: I quit my job last year after 10 years.

Before quitting, I calculated my runway: 31 months.

That number gave me confidence. Turned "can I?" into "I have 2.5 years."

Built this to give others that same clarity 🙂
```

### First Comment (PH Post)

**Template:**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I just quit my engineering job after 10 years.

Before I quit, I calculated my runway: **31 months**.

Not 31 months of money—31 months of TIME.

Time to try 3 startup ideas. Time to learn. Time to find my path.

That clarity changed everything. So I built a tool to help you find yours.

---

❌ Fake scarcity ("Only 24 hours!")  
❌ Ignoring criticism  
❌ Copy-paste replies  
❌ Disappearing after launch  
❌ Over-promising features

---

## Emergency Playbook

**If ranking is low at Hour 6:**
- Don't panic (rankings fluctuate)
- Double down on engagement
- Drive external traffic harder
- Ask supporters to comment (not just upvote)
- Focus on quality discussions

**If getting negative feedback:**
- Don't argue
- Acknowledge valid points
- Fix bugs ASAP
- Thank them for honesty
- Show roadmap (we're listening)

**If something breaks:**
- Announce it immediately
- "We're aware of [bug], fixing now"
- Post update when fixed
- Apologize, move on

**If you're exhausted:**
- Take a 30-min break
- Have coffee ready
- Remember: it's a marathon, not sprint
- Delegate comment replies (if you have a co-founder)
