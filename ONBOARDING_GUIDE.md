## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: **Always Overestimate Expenses** 💰
**Why:** Unexpected costs happen (car repair, medical, etc.)  
**How:** Add 10-15% buffer to your monthly expenses  
**Example:** Real expenses $3K → Enter $3,300

---

### Tip 2: **Underestimate Side Income** 📉
**Why:** Freelance work is unpredictable  
**How:** Use 70% of your average income  
**Example:** Avg $1,000/mo → Enter $700/mo

---

### Tip 3: **Use Phase Planning for Any Non-Linear Journey** 📅
**Examples:**
- Study period (high expense) → Job search (lower)
- Cheap country → Expensive country
- Bootstrap (low burn) → Funded (high burn)

**Why:** Averaging hides the truth. Phases reveal reality.

---

### Tip 4: **Compare at Least 3 Scenarios** 🔄
**Best practice:**
- Scenario A: Conservative (safe)
- Scenario B: Realistic (balanced)
- Scenario C: Aggressive (risky)

**Why:** See the full spectrum of possibilities.

---

### Tip 5: **Set Milestones, Not Just End Goals** 🎯
**Instead of:**
- "Launch business in 12 months"

**Try:**
- Month 3: MVP done
- Month 6: First customer
- Month 9: $1K MRR
- Month 12: $5K MRR

**Why:** Milestones keep you motivated and on track.

---

### Tip 6: **Export PDF Before Big Decisions** 📄
**Use cases:**
- Show partner/spouse
- Share with financial advisor
- Present to family for approval
- Keep for your own records

**How:** Dashboard → Export PDF → Share

---

### Tip 7: **Join the Community** 💬
**Why:**
- Learn from others' experiences
- Get accountability
- Discover optimization strategies
- Share your wins

**Where:**
- Discord: [link]

- Twitter: @personal_runway

---

### Tip 8: **Update Your Numbers Monthly** 🔄
**Set a reminder:**
- 1st of each month
- Update savings, expenses, income
- Recalculate runway
- Adjust scenarios if needed

**Why:** Life changes. Your plan should too.

---

### Tip 9: **Use FIRE Calculator Even If Not "FIRE"** 🔥
**Why:** Knowing your FI Number gives perspective

**Example:**
- You want to switch careers
- FI Number: $1M
- Current: $50K
- **Insight:** You're 5% to freedom
- **Motivation:** Keep building that cushion

---

### Tip 10: **Don't Forget Taxes** 🏦
**Reality check:**
- Freelance income is pre-tax
- Budget for 25-30% tax (US)
- Set aside tax money monthly

**Example:**
- Freelance income: $2,000/mo
- After tax (70%): $1,400/mo
- **Enter $1,400** in the calculator
