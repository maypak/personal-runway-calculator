## 🎯 What's New (4 Major Features)

**Why it matters:**
> *"I was opening 3 browser tabs to compare. Now I can see all my options at once."*

이제 한국어로 사용 가능:
- ✅ 전체 UI 한국어 번역

**FIRE 코리아 카페 회원 여러분, 환영합니다!** 🎉

---

### 3. **FIRE Calculator** 🔥
**The #1 request from FIRE seekers**

Finally, a proper Financial Independence calculator:
- 📊 **FI Number** - 4% rule calculation
- 📅 **FI Date** - When you'll reach independence (with investment returns)
- 🏖️ **Coast FIRE** - When you can stop saving and let investments grow
- 📈 **Progress Tracking** - Visual journey to FI

**Why it matters:**
> *"Other tools just track savings. This tells me WHEN I can retire."*  
> — 박준영, Doctor planning FIRE at 40

**Join 1.5M+ FIRE community members already using it.**

---

### 4. **Phase Planning** 📅
**Game-changer for sabbaticals and career transitions**

Model complex journeys with different phases:
- 🌏 **Multi-location sabbaticals** (Asia 3mo $3K → Europe 3mo $5K)
- 📚 **Study + Job search** (Course 6mo $2.5K → Search 6mo $3.5K)
- 🚀 **Startup phases** (Bootstrap 6mo → Funded 12mo)
- 🔄 **Career pivots** (Freelance 3mo → Job search 3mo)

**Why it matters:**
> *"Finally! My sabbatical isn't 'one budget for 12 months'. It's Japan (expensive) → India (cheap) → Job hunt (moderate)."*  
> — Emma, planning world tour sabbatical

**No other tool lets you plan phases. This is revolutionary.**

Title: [Tool] Personal Runway Calculator - FIRE Calculator with FI Date, Coast FIRE, Scenario Comparison (Beta Launch Mar 24)

Body:
Hey r/FI community!

I've been working on a tool specifically for FIRE planning, and we're launching public beta on March 24. Would love your feedback.

**What it does:**
- FI Number calculator (4% rule)
- FI Date projection (with investment returns)
- Coast FIRE calculation
- Scenario comparison (Lean FIRE vs Fat FIRE, etc.)
- Phase-based planning (work → coast → FI)

**Why I built this:**
I was using Excel to plan my FIRE journey (targeting age 40). Took me hours to set up formulas, and I couldn't easily compare different scenarios (what if I save 5% more? What if I coast at 35?).

**What makes it different:**
- Visual, interactive (not Excel hell)
- Compare unlimited scenarios side-by-side
- Mobile-friendly
- Korean + English (for my fellow Korean FIRE folks)

**Beta Perks:**
- Pro features FREE for 6 months
- Lifetime 30% discount
- Direct feedback channel

**Beta testers said:**
- "FI Date calculator told me: 44 months. Excel took 2 hours." - Doctor, FIRE at 40
- "Finally shows me WHEN I can stop working, not just how much to save." - Engineer

**Not affiliated with any financial advisor.** This is a calculator tool, not financial advice. Always DYOR.

Questions welcome!

- Taking time off to study/travel

**What beta testers said:**

Title: [Tool] Planning your digital nomad runway? Calculator with multi-location phases (Beta Mar 24)

Body:
Hey DN community!

Built a tool for planning nomad transitions with *realistic* budgets per location.

**The problem:**
"I have $30K saved. Can I do 3mo Bali + 3mo Thailand + 6mo Europe while building my business?"

Excel doesn't handle phase-based planning well.

**The solution: Personal Runway Calculator**
- Phase planning: Bali 3mo ($2K/mo) → Thailand 3mo ($1.5K/mo) → Europe 6mo ($4K/mo)
- Scenario comparison: Slow travel vs fast travel
- Side income modeling: Freelance income while traveling

**Beta testers:**
- "Finally! My sabbatical isn't 'one budget for 12mo'. It's Tokyo (expensive) → Bali (cheap)." - Marketer
- Rating: 7.4/10

**Beta perks (Mar 24):**
- Free for 6 months
- Lifetime discount
- Multi-currency coming soon (USD, EUR, KRW now)

**r/startups (1.5M members):**
```
Title: [Tool] Runway calculator for founders - Compare bootstrap vs VC scenarios (Beta Mar 24)

Body:
Hey r/startups!

Built a runway calculator specifically for founders trying to decide: bootstrap or raise?

**What it does:**
- Compare scenarios: 12mo bootstrap vs 24mo VC-funded
- Factor in side income / consulting
- Phase planning: MVP → Launch → Growth (different burn rates)

**Why I built this:**
Was advising a friend: "Should I take VC or bootstrap longer?" We spent 3 hours in Excel building scenarios. Thought: this should be 5 minutes.

**What makes it different from burn rate calculators:**
- Scenario comparison (see all options at once)
- Personal runway + startup runway combined
- Visual, not spreadsheet hell

**Beta tester (serial founder):**
"Scenario comparison showed me: 18mo bootstrap vs 36mo VC. Decision made. Worth $30/mo easy."

**Beta launch: March 24**
- Free for 6 months
- Lifetime 30% discount ($10.50/mo after)

Would love feedback from fellow founders!
